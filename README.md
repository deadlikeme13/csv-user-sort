# csv-user-sort

Take a .csv file and sort each user in the file based on their address and create a file for each unique country.

The headers for the file should be:
id, first_name, last_name, email, address, country, postal

Columns data follows the following rules:
- id - integer between 1-999999
- first_name and last_name - string at least 2 characters long, letters only (non numbers, no spaces)
- email - valid email string (any characters)
- address - string at least 2 characters long (containing number/letters/spaces, up to 5 words)
- country - string 2-3 characters long, capitals only
- postal - string between 4-8 characters, uppercase letters only

If any column is missing or does not contain valid data that record is placed in the errors.csv file.

If postal code does not match country that record is placed in the bad_address.csv file:
- US = 12345
- CND = A1A 1A1 || A1A1A1 || A1A-1A1
- Other countries = any valid postal should be accepted
